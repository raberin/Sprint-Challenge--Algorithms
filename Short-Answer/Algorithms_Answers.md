#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) It is O(n) operation due to the increasing n causing the while loop to extend


b) O(n^2) due to double for loop 


c) O(c^n) due to recursive nature

## Exercise II
I would do a merge sort approach. This has a O(log(n) time complexity due to the nature of the "breaking in half logic and moving my midpt"
1. Throw an egg at the middle floor
2. if it breaks, f is lower and i'll choose a floor between 1st - (middle - 1) floor
2. if it doesnt break, f is higher and ill choose a floor between (middle + 1) -> highest floor
3. I'm going to keep doing this until I find f
